            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                I’m from Yonkers, New York and growing up I played a lot of soccer and did random things on the side such as ice skating competitively and playing chess competitively. As time moved on, I started to gain an interest in anime/ manga around high school but recently I haven’t been updated with the new trends going on. During this time, I also got into gaming, and met some cool people on a Minecraft server and still play/ talk to them to this day. I played a lot of multiplayer games such as Counter Strike Go, League of Legends, and Overwatch, and to an extent I still play a few of those games to this day with the addition of Valorant from time to time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main reason I went to college was because I didn’t know what to do after high school and I wanted a high paying job so I thought this would be the best way to do so. I’d also make my parents proud being one of the first people not only going to college but graduating as my relatives would only make it to the first semester before dropping out (if they even attended college). After starting college I’ve barely played any video games, and I put more time into my studies (well at least for the first 2 years) than I ever have. I want to achieve my goal of working in the Software Engineering industry just for the money to be honest. I want to make enough money where I can help my parents and siblings, so they don’t have to worry about anything.

            <h2>Hometown</h2>
            <p>
                My hometown is the third most populated city in New York state with a population of 209,530, and the largest city in Westchester County. It’s a big melting pot here, I live in the suburbs, but I can easily drive 10/15 minutes in either direction to go to a more ghetto part of Yonkers, or to visit a neighborhood full of Hispanic people, Irish people, and the list goes on and on.

            <h2>My Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p> 
                One of my favorite things to do is programming, and this was introduced to me during my freshman year here. I started working on personal projects recently and it made me appreciate some languages more than others with how much less typing can be done compared to another. Ever since I was a kid I’d play soccer and it’s stuck with me, although I don’t play as much anymore I still enjoy watching/ keeping up with what's going on. Video games will always be a comfort for me because it helped me through difficult times.
