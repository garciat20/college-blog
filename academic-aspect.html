                        College can present itself with many challenges and one of the biggest challenges is the emotional aspect of it. There are so many things that can affect the way you feel/ think and a few of the most noticeable ones are relationships and financial status. The anxiety of being able to barely pay off rent and juggle courses while trying to also juggle relationships can be exhausting since there are so many responsibilities to take on. Through this struggle, there are always those who come out stronger but the cost to be stronger isn’t always the prettiest as those face grief, and pressure to fit in certain cliques and to succeed in their major to have a successful future. All these little things accumulate and can cause an unpleasant time for students as feelings of loneliness, isolation, helplessness, and anxiety to ease into their life. It’s important to surround yourself around people who care for you, and if that isn’t a possibility it’s okay to reach for professional help to help you in those tough times.
